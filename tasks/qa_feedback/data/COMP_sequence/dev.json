The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist, on 28 June 1914, lead to the July Crisis. Which was a month of diplomatic maneuvering between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain. Wanting to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia and the Balkans, Austria-Hungary delivered the July Ultimatum to Serbia. When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914, just a month after the assassination."
